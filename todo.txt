********* Questions for the team **********


* Is there a difference between "Volunteer With Us" and "Partner With Us"?

* Is the Partner With Us Collage-thing something you want on every page?

* What font is used in the partner-with-us collage?


********* Things to do **********


Homepage: 

* Modify partner with us button. Ask them about this, and whether or not we want a gradient over the collage. Also see if we want this on every page. Perhaps we want more stuff on that collage? Also, "Partner With Us" or "Volunteer"?


Who-We-Are:

* Pad the donate section better. Clean it up.

* Clean up the who we are spacing

* Implement the photo gallery of SVI members/council/volunteer

* Implement some javascript so we can pop up the bios for SVI team members


Your-Vote-Matters: 

* Space out the collapsible sections from each other better

* Add in an animation to the expand/collapse

* Implement the photo gallery of politicians (should be similar to Who-We-Are section) 


General:

* Reduce redundant code by using the javascript-injected-html code hack.

* Clean up space, add to github everything important

* Reformat the code, get a linter going

* Get Adela to give you general updates on the backend
